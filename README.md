### Hello! I'm Mir Lodro 👋

I am a Senior Research Associate in RF Cyber Security at the University of Bristol. Currently, I am working as part of the EPSRC-funded project Secure Wireless Agile Networks (SWAN), where I am developing a testbed for collaborative spectrum sensing for dynamic spectrum sharing.
I enjoy working with software-defined radios using the GNU radio signal processing toolkit.
My academic background includes:
- 🎓 **PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** from the University of Nottingham (2021)
- 🎓 **MRes in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** from the University of Nottingham (2015)

My professional experience includes:
- 🧑‍🔬 **Postdoctoral Research** in RF and Communication Engineering at the University of Nottingham (2021-2022)
- 🧑‍🔬 **Postdoctoral Research** in Signal Processing for 5G and beyond Networks at Loughborough University (2022)

I am passionate about exploring the intersections of RF communication, radio propagation, and signal processing.
